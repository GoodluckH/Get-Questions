As an investor, I generate many questions during the research process. Often, these questions are buried in vairous places of my notes. 

Get Questions is a simple web-based tool to quickly extract a list of questions in your notes. It's a really simple Regex exercise but it has been helpful for organizing my research process.

Feel free to clone or fork the project if you think it can be improved.
